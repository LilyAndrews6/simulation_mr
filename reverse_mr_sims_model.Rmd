Model:
forward mr
       u
     |    |
     v    v
g -> x -> y  
genetic liability
         -> x  <- 
g -> gl           u
         -> y  <- 
reverse mr
       u
     |    |
     v    v
g -> y -> x

Strategy:   
sample 1: Do GWAS to identify causal variants for y based on heritability and sample size
- we know how many hits there are for glioma, and their effects, variance explained
- we know heritability of glioma

sample 2: Reverse MR of discovered genetic variants for y against x with sample sizes for x based on available data
- mr association
  - fraction of liability in y discovered, correlated with x
  - sample size

sample 3: Individual level data where x and y are both measured - obs association
- correlation between x and y will be due to 
  - total liability of y associating with x
  - total liability of y associating with y
  - confounding effect
  - sample size
